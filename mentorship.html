        Our Mentorship Program
     </h6>

  <p class="main-p">
    Did you know that as a part of our programming, we offer free mentorship to any students in need? This year, we piloted our first official mentorship program, where we matched up students with members of our team and other volunteers who are a little further ahead in their academic and scientific journey. This way, we could provide one-on-one guidance to students from someone in a similar field, and perhaps from a similar background. Our mentorship program is designed to help our students build a network, get advice from people with similar experiences, and to empower them with more knowledge, confidence, and opportunities than perhaps they had before being mentored. It is not mandatory to take our crash course to become a mentee, and we encourage you to sign up if you are interested! </p>
<p class="main-p"> In this light, as a part of the MGP, we offer two mentoring components.
    
    <ol>
        <li> You would like to be matched to a mentor from our team to go over your submitted MGP application. Within one week of submitting your application, a member of our team will schedule a one-on-one meeting with you to go over your application and provide some input and advice, if needed. In the event that changes are made, the application can be re-submitted (with the original submission date preserved). This is meant to provide our applicants with real-life training in writing grant applications. </li>
        <li> You would like to be matched to a mentor from our team or from our volunteer pool to be matched to you going forward in your academic journey. If so, please attach an additional half page to your application with the following: </li> 
            <ul>
                <li> Full name and country of origin</li>
                <li> Field of study</li>
                <li> Current education level status and program 
                </li>
                <li> Future goals for your evolutionary biology journey, immediate and/or future 
                </li>
                <li> Languages spoken and preferred language(s) of interaction 
                </li>
                <li> What you hope to get out of the mentoring program
                </li>
                <li> Your preferred means of communication
                </li>
            </ul>

      </ol>
