        Our Mentorship Program
     </h6>

  <p class="main-p">
    Our mentoring program is a chance for you to be matched one-on-one with one of our volunteer mentors. We do our best to match you with someone who has a similar background and/or similar field of study and interests, and we seek to ensure there is a common language you can both use comfortably. We have a database of mentors who we cross reference every mentee’s application with, and we then match you through email. Thereafter, it is up to you and your mentor to determine how often you want to chat, what about, and on what platform.
 </p>
 
    <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> Our mentors </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        We have rounded up a diverse, passionate, experienced selection of evolutionary biologists at different stages of their career, and in an assortment of disciplines. Many of our mentors are also contributing members of other EvoBio Crash Course opportunities. 
          We come from all over the world, and have a collective wealth of knowledge and experience that we are always looking to share. We don’t get paid for our time, or awarded with credits or the like. Rather, we are driven by our collective passion to make the evolutionary biology community more accessible, representative, and diverse, for we know that only with our collective voices, perspectives, and insights will we continue to advance the field and better our world. 
      </p>


      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> Collaborative Mentoring  </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        When you become a mentee in our program, we also add you into our SLACK mentorship group, where other mentors and mentees can contact one another, or post interesting content, opportunities, and questions for group response. 

      </p>

      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> What Kind of Topics do we Address?  </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        
As you develop a stronger relationship with your mentor, you will likely become quite focused and specific in what you discuss. That being said, we do have some topics which are commonly brought up during the experience: 
<ul class="ul-non-nested">
    <li class="li-non-nested">    The mentor’s own academic journey (where they studied, what topic, how they funded it, how they enjoyed it, what they did, barriers and opportunities, mistakes and learning moments, success events, advice, etc.) 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested"> The mentees own academic goals (where you are now, your backstory, your academic, personal, and societal goals, your barriers and opportunities, your next steps, etc.) 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Where to find information about programs, scholarships, other opportunities 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Things to think about when applying for and deciding on the next step of your education
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Logistical components to consider, from finances to moving abroad to housing 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Navigating social media as a scientist 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Building a network 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Making yourself a competitive applicant 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Fighting stereotypes and social barriers 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Addressing financial and political obstacles to your education
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Dealing with stress, anxiety, self confidence 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Navigating relationships with supervisors, peers, and colleagues 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Handling external components of life that impact your academic life 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Advice on specific situations 
    </li>

 </ul>
 <p class="main-p"> 
    And it goes on and on! What we really want to emphasize here is that the program is designed to engage and provide support to students like you, students in the early stages of their evolutionary biology career who may be facing difficult barriers and obstacles to success, or who may just need someone to talk to for advice and perspective. In particular, we encourage students from the Global South to apply, for we recognize that the barriers you face at a systemic level are more encompassing than the typical student. That being said, we always welcome everyone to apply and we encourage you to give it a shot, and to pass on this opportunity to others! 
 </p>
 
      </p>

      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> Costs and Commitments </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
         
Our mentorship program is entirely free! We want to make our program as accessible as we can, and so it is both free of cost and offered online, so we can connect people from all over the world. 
<br>
<br>
OK, so now that we know it is free, what does it cost in terms of time? Well, this is entirely up to you and your mentor! There is no minimum or maximum time commitment, or time span commitment, for which you have to sign up. Rather, you and your mentor should discuss this when you first connect to set expectations and define needs. 

      </p>


      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> How do I Join? </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
    
Our mentorship program is designed to help our students build a network, get advice from people with similar experiences, and to empower them with more knowledge, confidence, and opportunities than perhaps they had before being mentored. If you are interested in joining, please email us at evobio.crash.course@gmail.com with the following information: 

<ul class="ul-non-nested">
    <li class="li-non-nested"> Full name 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Country of origin and country of current studies 
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Field(s) of study
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Current education level and program
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Future goals for your evolutionary biology journey, immediate and/or future - what are your next steps (the main goal of our mentorship is to help you achieve this)
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Languages spoken and preferred language(s) of interaction
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">What you hope to get out of the mentoring program
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Your preferred means of communication
    </li>
    <li class="li-non-nested">Any special requirements (for example, only being comfortable with a mentor who identifies as (or who does not identify as) a specific gender) 
    </li>

</ul>
    
      </p>

      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> What Happens Next  </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        
Our mentorship team will review your application and try to match you with an available mentor who is best fitting your profile. Sometimes you will be matched with someone who isn’t quite in the same specific field of study, but who’s experience, advice, and knowledge is expected to be both valuable and transferable to you. 

      </p>


      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> What Academic Subjects are our Mentors Engaging in? </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        
When we asked our mentors what their fields of study and fields of interest are, they told us the following:

Evolutionary biology, ecology, evolutionary ecology, genomics, conservation, phylogenetics, paleontology, taxonomy, speciation, adaptation, behavioral ecology, population dynamics, demography, bioinformatics, human development, somatic evolution, physiology, microbial evolution, horizontal gene transfer, theoretical biology, eusociality, cooperative breeding, senescence, sexual selection, plasticity, inversions, molecular biology, reproduction, sex determination systems, gene conflicts, conservation genomics, palaeogenomics, metagenomics, host-parasite interactions, network analysis, herbarium-based research, genome skimming, polar ecology, museomics, biodiversity analysis, DNA metabarcoding, human evolution, ancient DNA, biological anthropology, life-history theory, spatial mapping, wildlife trade tracing, recombination landscapes, neural science, macroevolution, and more!
<br>
<br>
Aside from their academic interests, our mentors have other passions they would love to share with you. Be it hiking, baking, poetry, video gaming, traveling, painting, and so on, don’t be afraid to ask about their interests outside their academic careers! 

      </p>

      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description"> Enjoying your Mentorship Experience? 
        </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
We seek to use our platform to raise the voices of students who are facing extra barriers to their next steps in education. If you are having a good mentoring experience, consider sharing about it (with the consent of your mentor) on social media! On Twitter, you can tag us  <a class="form" href="https://twitter.com/EvoBioCC" target="_blank"> @EvoBioCC</a> and use the hashtag <span class="italic">#EvoBioMentorship</span> to tell others about your experience and hopefully inspire more people to access our course and opportunities. 

      </p>

      <h5>
        <div class="h5-description">  Notes on Confidentiality </div>  
      </h5>
      <p class="main-p"> 
        
We recognize that engaging in a mentorship program makes both the mentor and the mentee somewhat vulnerable, in that they may share personal and emotional stories from their experiences. This is part of the beautiful process of sharing, but it can also be a bit scary. We encourage you to discuss confidentiality with your mentor early on, and decide how you two want to approach your discussions. This will be a collaborative decision, and will determine what you share with one another, what you are able to share with other people, and what information is or is not appropriate to give out. As mentors, we are happy to be a source of confidentiality for you and your academic experiences. Our only condition is that we have an obligation to inform a proper authority if we feel that you confide in us something which would suggest you are a threat to the wellbeing and safety of yourself and/or others. We hope that you understand this condition, and we enact it to protect everyone. 

      </p>
