        Representation matters. Here at the Evolutionary Biology Crash Course Team, everyone is aware of the disproportionate financial obstacles that young student researchers from the Global South face when trying to access the next steps of their education. As a team, we have sought to develop an intensive and successful crash course as a means to help students achieve a better understanding of evolutionary biology, and increase their chances to access high level education programmes. We want to enable all students to have the same opportunity to pursue an impactful, rewarding, and meaningful career in evolutionary biology. In tandem with our crash course, we have decided to launch an official Evolutionary Biology Crash Course Mini Grant Program (The MGP). 
            </p>
    
    
    <p class="main-p">
                Our MGP is designed to enable us to give a little help to as many students as we can, to assist them in overcoming a tangible barrier they may face when applying for or accessing their next step of education in evolutionary biology. Our goal is to review as many cases as we can, and if our funds permit, and if the applications meet our criteria, we hope to provide the grant. 
    </p>

      <div class="h5-description"> Specifics </div>  
    </h5>
    
    
    <p class="main-p">
        In order to stretch our funds to as many students as possible, we can offer at most 300 Euros per application and person. Applications below this amount are also accepted and encouraged, and applications above this amount will only be remunerated for 300 Euros. We recognize that different programs and opportunities have differing timelines for applying, and so the MGP has no set deadline for applying. Rather, we allocate funds on an ongoing basis, while funds are available. We seek to stagnate our acceptance of applications in order to make support available over the year. We are thus unable to guarantee application success for everyone, and we reserve the right to pause submissions at any given time.  
            </p>
    

    <h5>
    <div class="h5-description"> Criteria for Application </div>  
    </h5>
             
              
    <p class="main-p">
        In order to ensure we enable those most in need to access the MGP, we have set the following criteria:         
        <ol>
            <li>Our MGP is catered to applicants from the Global South, however we have elected to keep our criteria open to all those whoâ€™s individual or family circumstance is that of demonstrated financial need. Financial need is the difference between cost and ability to pay. Here we expect that applicants make an honest application, and truly evaluate if the MGP is the only thing that can enable them to overcome this barrier. We are seeking to help students who this MGP will mean being able to apply or not for a key program or opportunity.</li>
            <li>The barrier the applicant is trying to overcome must be related to accessing an opportunity or next step in their education. The educational opportunity must be related to evolutionary biology. Example barriers include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>   Qualifications needed for consideration of an educational program (the IELTS and TOEFL tests, other language proficiency certifications, etc.)              </li>
                    <li>   Fees for applying to a program </li>
                    <li>   Fees related to certifying and translating diplomas needed as proof of education (to be used in applications for the next step of education) </li>
                    <li>   Fees for taking a specific course needed to meet application requirements to a next step in education.</li>
                </ul>
            <li> The applicant must demonstrate that the barrier the applicant is trying to overcome with the MGP can lead to fruitful results. In other words, the MGP should not be used to apply for a program or opportunity where the student cannot attend if they are admitted. However, if there are specific scholarships being offered for which the student may be qualified, if there is no tuition, or some other setup that allows or may allow the student to access the program upon being admitted, then this is accepted and should be explained in the application. </li> 
            <li> The applicant must demonstrate evidence that this barrier exists, what the total (estimated) costs of the barrier are, the currency the barrier is in, the currency the applicant would be paying in, and provide a link to the barrier so that it can be reviewed.  </li> 
            <li> The applicant must have a bank account in their name which can receive international transfers. In exceptional cases, the account can be in the name of an immediate family member. This should be specified and justified within the application.  </li> 
            <li> The application must be for an upcoming barrier. Barriers that were paid for 30 days or more before the application date are not eligible. The barrier must be occurring within 6 months of the application, but not earlier than 30 days before the date of application. </li> 

          </ol>
